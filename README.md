The digital home of **Marius Obert** — a place where conference talks, blog posts, podcast episodes, and open source projects pretend to be organized.

Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and... just kidding. Built with love and too many late-night commits.

## What's in here?

- **Writing** — Articles, blog posts, and one actual book (yes, on paper)
- **Speaking** — Conference talks from Amsterdam to Bucharest, plus a German podcast about money and tech
- **Coding** — Open source projects that may or may not still work

## The Stack

React · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · shadcn/ui · Vitest · GitHub Pages

## Philosophy

```
if (isPersonalWebsite && !isFinished) {
  ship(it);
}
```

## License

MIT — because sharing is caring.
